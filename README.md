# RGB_D_DA

The code is in the mainFile.py. The main function calls the training function. Image output can be checked in the training loop by using pyplt.imshow() before calling the model inside the training loop. This is purposely not being done right now to avoid computation overhead.

The datasets needs to be uninstalled to "newdata" folder inside the project folder. A "savedModels" folder also needs to be created to store models.
